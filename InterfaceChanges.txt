This is a temporary text file storing the interface changes made between
version 1.0 and version 2.0.  This sticks around long enough for these to
be moved to the IceT documentation.

Names of include files.

Many GL* types converted to IceT* types.

ICET_READ_BUFFER -> ICET_GL_READ_BUFFER

Added icetGLInitialize.

Added icetGLSetReadBuffer.

ICET_COLOR_FORMAT -> ICET_GL_COLOR_BUFFER.  Also add ICET_GL_DEPTH_BUFFER
and setting functions icetGLSetColorFormat and IcetGLSetDepthFormat.

Added icetPhysicalDisplaySize, ICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_WIDTH, and
ICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_HEIGHT.

Replaced icetUnsafeStateGet with multiple typed versions to make it
somewhat less unsafe.

Better formalized the IceTImage object and exposed an end user interface
for creating an image and accessing the data.  This includes
ICET_IMAGE_COLOR_* and ICET_IMAGE_DEPTH_* enumerations.  It also includes
adding the functions icetImageBufferSize, icetImageInitialize, and
icetImageGet*.

Changed the IceTImage object from simply being a pointer to being a struct
with opaque internals.  This provides several safety features.  First, it
makes it a compile error to try to assign pretty much anything to an
IceTImage that is not an IceTImage (and likewise for IceTSparseImage).
Second, it decouples the idea of a buffer and an image so the two don't get
mixed up.  Third, the icetImageInitialize now takes a buffer and returns an
image object (likewise for sparse), so there is never any question about
the initialization state.  It is either allocated and completely
initialized or it is not.  Fourth, this also helps encourage me to build
functions that take responsibility for "creating" images.  It can input a
buffer and output an image.

Changed icetDrawFrame to return an IceTImage.

Removed icetGetColorBuffer and icetGetDepthBuffer functions.  Also removed
the ICET_COLOR_BUFFER, ICET_DEPTH_BUFFER, ICET_COLOR_BUFFER_VALID, and
ICET_DEPTH_BUFFER_VALID state variables.  Rather than store the previous
image composited, simply return the image from icetDrawFrame.

Converted all depth buffers to floating point.  The OpenGL spec clamps
floating point depth buffers to the range [0,1], so it should be OK to just
assume that the max depth is 1.0.

Removed the ICET_ABSOLUTE_FAR_DEPTH state variable (see above).

Added icetGetEnumv and icetGetBitFieldv.  They are similar to
icetGetIntegerv except that they disallow conversions from floating points
and pointers.  They also get around errors conerning casting from unsigned
to signed pointers.
